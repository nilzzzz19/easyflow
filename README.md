A scalable Spring boot app using Thymeleaf as a template engine to upload, download and delete a file

Set up your project:

Create a new Spring Boot project using your preferred IDE or the Spring Initializer website.
Add the following dependencies to your pom.xml file:
spring-boot-starter-web
spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf
spring-boot-starter-data-jpa (if you want to use a database to store the files)
Create the model:

Create a model class to represent the file, with fields such as the file name, content type, size, and data.
Set up the persistence layer:

If you want to use a database to store the files, you can use JPA to map the model class to a database table. You'll need to configure a DataSource and EntityManagerFactory bean in your application configuration.
Create the controller:

Create a controller class that handles the HTTP requests for uploading, downloading, and deleting files. The controller should have methods for handling each of these actions, such as a method for handling a file upload and saving it to the database.
Create the Thymeleaf templates:

Create Thymeleaf templates to render the HTML pages for uploading, downloading, and deleting files. These templates should use the model data to display information about the files and allow the user to perform the relevant actions.
Make the application scalable:

To make the application scalable, you can consider the following options:
Use a load balancer to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of the application.
Store the files in a cloud-based storage service, such as Amazon S3, so that you can easily scale the storage capacity as needed.
Use a caching layer, such as Redis, to cache frequently accessed data, reducing the load on the database.
Use a message queue, such as RabbitMQ, to handle asynchronous processing of file operations, so that the application can continue processing other requests while it is handling a file operation.
